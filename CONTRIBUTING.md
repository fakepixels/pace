Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pace CLI! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.24.4+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)

### Optional Tools

- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting
- [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) for releases

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fakepixels/pace.git
   cd pace
   ```

2. **Set up development environment:**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Make Commands

- `make dev` - Run the application in development mode
- `make serve` - Run the SSH server for development
- `make build` - Build binary for current platform
- `make test` - Run tests
- `make fmt` - Format code
- `make lint` - Run linter (requires golangci-lint)
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make help` - Show all available commands

### Code Style

- Run `make fmt` before committing
- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass
- Maintain good test coverage

## Release Process

Releases are automated using GoReleaser and GitHub Actions:

1. Create and push a git tag: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
2. Push the tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically create a release
