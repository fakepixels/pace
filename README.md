A CLI tool for Pace Capital announcements and updates, accessible both locally and over SSH.

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

If you have Go 1.24.4 or later installed. If you haven't, you can install Go by:

1. Visit [Go's official download page](https://go.dev/dl/)
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. Verify installation by opening a terminal and running:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

Once Go is installed:

```bash
go install github.com/fakepixels/pace@latest
```

### Option 2: Download Pre-built Binary

1. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/fakepixels/pace/releases/latest)
2. Download the archive for your operating system.
3. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   # For macOS/Linux:
   tar xzf pace_*_*.tar.gz
   
   # For Windows:
   # Use Windows Explorer to extract the .zip file
   ```
4. Move the binary to your PATH:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux:
   sudo mv pace /usr/local/bin/

   # Windows:
   # Move pace.exe to C:\Windows\System32\
   ```

## Usage

The Pace CLI can be run in two modes:

### 1. Local Mode (Default)

For a quick, local experience, simply run the command:
```bash
pace
```
This will launch the application directly in your current terminal session.

Navigate through the menu using:
- ‚Üë/‚Üì or k/j to move
- Enter to select
- b to go back
- q to quit

### 2. SSH Server Mode

To run the app as a secure SSH server that others can connect to, use the `--serve` flag:
```bash
pace --serve
```
This will start an SSH server. You can then connect to it from another terminal window:
```bash
ssh localhost -p 23234
```
The first time you start the server, it will automatically generate and save an SSH key in a `.ssh` directory. This key is used to secure the connection.
