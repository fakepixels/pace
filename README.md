```

### Package Managers

```

**Go Install:**

```

### Manual Installation

3. Extract and install:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux:

   sudo mv pace /usr/local/bin/

   # Windows:
   # Extract the .zip file and move pace.exe to your PATH
   ```

**Build from Source:**

Requirements: [Go 1.24.4+](https://golang.org/dl/)

```bash

cd pace
make build

```

## Usage

The Pace CLI can be run in two modes:

### 1. Local Mode (Default)

For a quick, local experience, simply run the command:
```bash
pace
```
This will launch the application directly in your current terminal session.

Navigate through the menu using:
- ‚Üë/‚Üì or k/j to move
- Enter to select
- b to go back
- q to quit

### 2. SSH Server Mode

To run the app as a secure SSH server that others can connect to, use the `--serve` flag:
```bash
pace --serve
```
This will start an SSH server. You can then connect to it from another terminal window:
```bash
ssh localhost -p 23234
```
The first time you start the server, it will automatically generate and save an SSH key in a `.ssh` directory. This key is used to secure the connection.
